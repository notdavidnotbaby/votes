# Votes Program for Aleo

The Votes program is a decentralized voting system implemented on the Aleo platform, which prioritizes privacy in blockchain applications. This Aleo program facilitates the creation, registration, and voting on proposals by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to maintain the confidentiality of voters while ensuring the integrity of the voting process.

## Features

- **Proposal Creation**: Users can create detailed proposals for voting.
- **Vote Registration**: Provides privacy tickets to vote on proposals.
- **Vote Tallying**: Counts agree and disagree votes on proposals.

## Requirements

- Aleo CLI
- Rust
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)

## Installation

To set up the Votes program, follow these steps:

1. Install the [Aleo CLI](https://docs.aleo.org/getting-started/installation).
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/votes.aleo.git
cd votes.aleo
```

3. Build the project using Cargo.

```shell
cargo build --release
```

## Usage
